# NY Citibike

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use Tableau to create visualizations for a business proposal to bring Citibike to Des Moines, Iowa. The visualizations are created using Citibike data from New York City so that investors can determine if it is worthwhile to launch Citibike in Des Moines. The visualizations created in Tableau show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, the number of trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and the top starting and ending locations.

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

The vast majority of Citibike users in NYC used the bikes for trip durations of 30 minutes or less. This could suggest that Citibike is most used for travel rather than for exercise or tourism.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Peak hours of Citibike usage on Monday - Friday are from 7 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM which would suggest that Citibike is used heavily on the weekdays for travel to and from work. On weekends, usage is spread more evenly across the day, suggesting Citibike is used for leisure on weekends.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Trips by weekday per hour broken out by gender, shows the same peak hour trends as the Trips by Weekday per Hour visualization, and shows that males use Citibike more in those peak hours than female or unknown genders.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Subscribers are more heavily male, while Customers are more evenly spread between genders. Subscribers use Citibike more on the weekdays than the weekends, while Customers use Citibike more on the weekends than weekdays. This suggests that Subscribers are generally New York City locals who use the bikes for transportation to work, while Customers are more likely to be tourists using the bikes to travel around the city, especially on the weekends.

### Top Starting and Ending Locations

Top starting locations and top ending locations are most heavily concentrated in Manhattan. This make sense because of how densely populated Manhattan is, and that it is a hub for both business and tourism.
